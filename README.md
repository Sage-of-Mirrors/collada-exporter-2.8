# SuperBMD Collada exporter for Blender

An addon for [Blender](https://www.blender.org) that intends to make it effortless
to export models and animations to a format compatible with [SuperBMD](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/SuperBMD),
a tool for creating assets for use with various GameCube-era Nintendo games.

Ultimately based on [Better Collada Exporter](https://github.com/godotengine/collada-exporter) by Juan Linietsky,
the [Blender 2.8 port](https://github.com/artellblender/collada-exporter-2.8) by artell, and [a bug-fix fork](https://github.com/sburris0/collada-exporter-2.8)
by sburris0.

## Installation

1. Copy the `superbmd_export` directory to the location where Blender stores the
   `scripts/addons` folder on your system (you should see various other
   folders there from other addons). Copy the entire dir and not just its
   contents.
2. Go to the Blender settings and enable the "SuperBMD Collada Exporter" plugin.

If you find bugs or want to suggest improvements, please open an issue
on Sage-of-Mirrors' [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/collada-exporter-2.8).
